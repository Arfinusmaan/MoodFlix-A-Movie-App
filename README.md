---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React (Vite), Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend**: Appwrite (Database, Functions)  
- **APIs**:
  - OMDB API (via backend)
  - YouTube Data API v3  

---

## 🔐 API Flow

1. User types a search query.  
2. Debounced input prevents rapid API calls.  
3. Query is sent to Appwrite Function/backend, which calls OMDB.  
4. Response is stored in Appwrite DB and sent back to frontend.  
5. Trending results update based on frequency of search terms.
